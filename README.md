# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains C programs and exercise answers, which are the result of my self-study of _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein. The idea is to learn about the theoretical aspects of the algorithms and at the same time learn to implement them in C.


## Part 1 - Foundations

### Getting Started

In the plot you see timings of C implementations of different sorting algorithms from the first chapter of Cormen et al. All algortims where timed on a collection of arrays in reverse order, so arrays on the form `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
