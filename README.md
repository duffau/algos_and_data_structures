# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo contains the C-code which is the result of my self-study of _Introduction to Algorithms_ by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest & Stein.  


## Part 1 - Foundations

### Getting Started

![Sorting algos worst case timings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/duffau/algos_and_data_structures/master/Part_1_Foundations/Chap_2_Getting_Started/time_measurments.png)

In the plot you see timings of my C implementation of different sorting algorithms from the first chapter of Cormen et al. All algortims where timed on a collection of arrays in reverse order, thats is array on the form `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
